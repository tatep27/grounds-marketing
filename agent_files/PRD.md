# PRD — Grounds Marketing Website (Proposed v2)

## 1) Project overview

- **Product**: Grounds — a digital outreach platform designed to strengthen physical community by helping local organizations communicate, engage, and involve their members more effectively.
- **Website purpose**: A marketing website that explains Grounds, builds trust, and converts interested visitors into qualified leads via a **waitlist / request access** CTA.
- **Primary CTA**: **Join waitlist / request access**
- **Secondary CTA (optional)**: Contact (email link).

## 2) Project context

Grounds exists to support places that already function as community anchors—such as libraries, community centers, nonprofits, and third-space businesses—but lack modern digital infrastructure for participation-driven outreach.

Physical community is becoming harder to access: information about local organizations is fragmented across websites and mailing lists, outreach is largely top-down, and community members often struggle to discover opportunities or feel a sense of belonging. Grounds addresses this gap by providing shared digital infrastructure that makes local community life more visible, participatory, and connected, without replacing in-person engagement.

## 3) Audience

- **Primary**: Local organization staff and decision-makers responsible for outreach, programming, and community engagement; often resource-constrained and overextended.
- **Secondary**: Community members seeking meaningful ways to participate in their local physical community.

---

## 4) Goals (what success looks like)

- **Clarity**: Visitors understand what Grounds is, who it’s for, and the core value quickly.
- **Conversion**: Visitors can easily join the waitlist / request access with minimal friction.
- **Trust**: Site communicates credibility (mission, approach, and any approved proof points).

**Key metrics**

- Waitlist conversion rate, form completion rate, CTA click-through, bounce rate.

---

## 5) Non-goals (out of scope for v1)

- A full authenticated product experience.
- Payments, subscriptions, or checkout.
- Additional pages beyond Home and About.

---

## 6) Core messaging

**Positioning statement**

- Grounds helps local organizations run participation-driven outreach so community life is more visible, connected, and easy to join.

**Message pillars**

- **Participation, not just broadcast**
- **Shared infrastructure for community anchors**
- **Supports in-person life**

**Tone**

- Clear, grounded, optimistic, non-hypey.

---

## 7) Information architecture (v1)

- **Home** (`/`)
  - Hero: what Grounds is + primary CTA
  - Who it’s for (org staff first; community members second)
  - Problem → solution narrative
  - How it works (high-level)
  - Trust/proof points (only if approved)
  - FAQ (optional)
  - Final CTA
- **About** (`/about`)
  - Mission, principles, “why now,” and how Grounds approaches strengthening physical community

---

## 8) Technical constraints & stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript.
- **Styling**: align to the repo’s existing styling approach.
- **Design system**: UI should be drawn from the existing design system using **Figma MCP** as the source of truth for components/tokens/patterns.

## Rules (agent must follow)

- **Always ask before proceeding**  
  The agent must pause after each proposal and wait for explicit user approval before continuing.
- **Propose before executing**  
  For any non-trivial work, the agent must first state what it plans to do next and why.
- **Surface gaps and assumptions**  
  The agent must call out missing information, ambiguities, or potential holes instead of filling them silently.
- **Explain actions briefly**  
  The agent should include a short explanation of why it is taking an action, to support learning and alignment.
- **Work in small, reviewable steps**  
  Favor incremental outputs over large, final solutions.
- **Do not expand scope**  
  Do not add features, details, or directions beyond what is explicitly requested.
